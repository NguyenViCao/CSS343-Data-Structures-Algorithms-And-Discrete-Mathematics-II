This  project  is  to  implement  Dijkstra's  shortest  path  algorithm.  Your  code  should  be  able  to 
read  a  data  file  consisting  of  many  lines  (an  example  file  called  data31.txt  will  be  given, 
explained below) and will be able to find the lowest cost paths (findShortestPath function) and 
display  the  cost  and  path  from  every  node  to  every  other  node  (displayAll  function). Another 
display routine (display function) will output one path in detail.
