This project is to create a binary search tree class called BinTree along with some additional 
functions (remove function is not required).  
 
Your code should be able to read a data file consisting of many lines (an example file called 
data2.txt will be given containing lines as shown below) to build binary search trees.  
iii not tttt eee r not and jj r eee pp r sssss eee not tttt ooo ff  m m y z $$ 
b a c b a c $$ 
c b a $$ 
 
Each line consists of many strings and terminates with the string “$$”. Each line will be used to 
build one tree. The duplicated strings (i.e., having equal values with existing node data) are 
discarded, smaller strings go left, and bigger go right.
